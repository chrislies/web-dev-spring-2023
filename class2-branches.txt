feature branch workflow:
1] use new branch for new feature
2] git checkout main (to make sure you are on main branch)
3] git pull (to make sure your local main branch is the same as the remote)
4] git checkout -b new-branch
5] git push -u origin new-branch (after making changes)
-- now delete the new-branch
6] git checkout main
7] git pull -p (to update your local repo so that it is the same as your remote)
8] git branch -d new-branch
9] git branch

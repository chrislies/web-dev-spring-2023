[x] redux-thunk: 
	- handles asynchronous actions
	- thunk middleware
		- checks the incoming action
			- if action is a reg. object, do nothing
			- if action is a function, invoke it, and pass the store's dispatch and getState methods to it
[x] WHY THUNK?
* Helps you stay DRY
	- Several different components might want to make the same API requests.
* Removes “responsibility” for asynchronous code/side effects from components
	- Components don’t need to know whether an action is async or not - they just dispatch!

// the "action type”
const GET_PUGS = 'GET_PUGS'

// the "action creator"
const gotPugs = (pugs) => {
// the "action"
return {
	type: GET_PUGS,
	pugs
	}
}

// the "thunk creator"
const getPugs = () => {
// the "thunk"
return async (dispatch, getState) => {
	const {data} = await axios.get('/api/pugs')
	dispatch(gotPugs(data))
	}
}

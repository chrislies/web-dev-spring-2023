[x] Using React

npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

//go to src, then App.js to edit

react: a lightweight framework 
[x] always renders one page

jsx: syntax extension to js


  // <p>hi</p>
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>

App: component (components start with a capital letter)
<p>hi</p>: element

React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.

Each component should have its own file

React Only Updates What’s Necessary
React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

should only call root.render once in index.js
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Sara" />
      <Welcome name="Cahal" />
      <Welcome name="Edite" />
    </div>
  );
}

Props are Read-Only
Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props. Consider this sum function:

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
Such functions are called “pure” because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.

In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:

function withdraw(account, amount) {
  account.total -= amount;
}

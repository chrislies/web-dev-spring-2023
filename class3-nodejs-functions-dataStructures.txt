- node.js: to run javascript outside of the browser

- javascript 
- 'let' and 'const' used to declare variables
	- ex: let x = 10; 
	- ex: const y = 20;  //const can only be declared once (ex. y = 19; would produce a type error)
- variables declared inside functions are local to that function block only (not global)
- variables declared outside of functions are in the global scope
- function declaration
[x] simpler method:
	function square(x) {
		return x * x;
	}
[x] arrow method: (takes up less lines of code)
	const square = (x) => { return x * x; };
	or
	const sqaure2 = x => x * x;
- use triple equals === in place of two equals ==
== is the equality operator. It tests if two values are equal, after converting both values to a common type if needed. For example: 5 == "5" is true because both values are equal when converted to the same type (i.e., the number 5 and the string "5").

=== is the strict equality operator. It tests if two values are equal, without converting both values to a common type. For example: 5 === "5" is false because the values are not equal without type conversion (i.e., the number 5 is not equal to the string "5").

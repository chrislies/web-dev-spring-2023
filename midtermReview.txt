[x] hooks (use) cannot be used in class components
[x] functional components are defined by js functions (arrow, etc.)
- to make a functional component stateful, import and use the useState hook

[x] axios vs fetch
- fetch: 
  1) dont have to import a library to use 
  2) do have to settle two promises to get the data
      - one for response, another for getting the JSON data from the response
- axios: 
  1) we just need one promise

[x] higher order functions
- ex: 
function repeat(n,action) {
  for(let i = 0; i<n; i++) {
    action(i);
  }
}
repeat(5,i => console.log(i));    //0-4
repeat(5,i => console.log(i+1));  //1-5

- ex2:
function lessThan(n) {
  return m => m < n;    //lessThan11(6)
}
// how can we use the lessThan() to determine if 6 < 11?
const lessThan11 = lessThan(11);
console.log(lessThan11(6));

[x] promises:
  - then and catch are not the only way to handle promises (async/await)

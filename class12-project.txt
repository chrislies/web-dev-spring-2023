...state //copies state array

thunk manages an asynchronous action (ex. network request)

frontend: requests; requests are sent from thunks
backend: response; not a react app; node (server using express)
	- use sequalize
- both ends should run independently from each other


actionType->actionCreator
actionType->actionThunk

adding a new action:
	- new actionCreator
	- new actionThunk
	- new reducer (How we will access state in the components)

thunks use the actionCreators
thunks are where we make API calls

dispatch sends requests to reducer
